# Water Board Project

Welcome to the Water Board Project! This repository serves as the foundation for a water quality management system that combines cutting-edge technology with intuitive design to provide actionable insights into water quality and chemical consumption.

### Project Overview

This application integrates SCADA systems, machine learning, and real-time notifications into an accessible interface for managing and improving water quality processes. Below are the core functionalities:

### Key Functionalities

1. **Comprehensive Dashboard**

   - Visualizes sensor data from SCADA systems.
   - Enables real-time monitoring and management.

2. **Predictive Systems**

   - Uses machine learning models to forecast:
     - Water quality trends.
     - Chemical consumption rates.

3. **Early Notifications**

   - Proactive alerts for water quality deviations to ensure timely actions.

4. **Flow Customization**
   - Tailored workflows adaptable to various institutions for managing water quality steps effectively.
